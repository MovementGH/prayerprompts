			About prayerprompts.com 
		</h1>
		<p>
			Disciples hear and follow Jesus, the Good Shepherd. Prayer is a vital component of this. Disciple Making Movement leaders say nothing is more important in a movement than prayer. Praying for an hour a day can seem impossible but prayer templates (or models) can be helpful in developing this habit. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind is that prayer models are like all disciple making tools. And tools are just tools. They are are not the end, they are simply a means to help accomplish the end. The goal of prayer is to draw closer to God, not to check a box and simply make it through. I hope you find this website helpful in leading you to spend more time in speaking with and listening to your Heavenly Father who loves you very much and wants you to help others hear and follow Him.

		<h2>
			Using this tool: 
		</h2>
		<p>
			It really is as easy as the instructions on the main page. I suggest you just click pray at the bottom of the main page and see what happens. Different prompts will appear throughout your time of prayer. The total duration you select is simply divided by the number of topics in the selected template. So if you choose 60 minutes and the Prayer Wheel, which has 12 topics, each topic will be given 5 minutes. The progress bar indicates time remaining for the current prompt.

			About the templates: 
		</h2>
		<p>
			Below are just a few words about each template. We wish we had more information about the origin of each one. Please let us know if you have additional information about any of these. You can also submit a template by <a target="_blank" href="https://newlife.church/">contacting us</a>.

		<h3>
			Prayer Wheel:
		</h3>
		<p>
			This template is used in multiple disciple making movements. I believe it goes back to Bill Smith, Ying Kai, and Curtis Sergeant but I'm not sure who originally developed it. Most disciple making movement leaders avoid taking personal credit for tools they developed. This is a great template to use when learning to pray for an hour. With 12 prompts each one takes 5 minutes. Find out more at <a target="_blank" href="https://zume.training/how-to-spend-an-hour-in-prayer/">zume.training</a>.

		<h3>
			Prayer Wheel (modified):
		</h3>
		<p>
			The prayer wheel is great as is but I have found the order to be a little awkward. This template contains the same prompts but in an order that works for me. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			ACTS:
		</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>A</strong>doration, <strong>C</strong>onfession, <strong>T</strong>hanksgiving, <strong>S</strong>ubmission. When I originally saw this, the S was for Supplication. I'm not a fan of big words so changed it to Submission. The intent is that we submit both our requests and ourselves to God. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			PRAY:
		</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>P</strong>raise, <strong>R</strong>epent, <strong>A</strong>doration, <strong>Y</strong>ield. Very similar to ACTS. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Lord's Prayer:
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Lord's prayer from Matthew 6 broken down into bite size chunks. I can't remember where I found the prompts themselves.
		</p>
		<h3>
			PASSION:
		</h3>
		<p>
			Developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://220life.com">Jeff McDaniel</a> who has led disciple making movements on more than one continent.
